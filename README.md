# Outdoor Camping Website (Web App)

## Problem

Creating a camping trip and inviting friends to said trip is impossible with current outdoor platforms.
We want to make that process easier.

## Proposal

Create a website that allows people to create a trip for a specific campground and invite users (by email) to that trip.

## User types

Campers:
- Can leave a trip they were invited to
- Can browse campgrounds to create their own trip

### Trip Owners:
- edit the details of a trip they create or delete
- invite people to trip

## Resources
NPS API: 
https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm

API Provides us with campground data for most campgrounds in the US

## Data model
- RESTful service:

- UML diagram:
