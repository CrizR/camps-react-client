# Outdoor Camping Website (Web App)

## Problem
 Existing outdoor platforms provide users with access to campsite information and availability but do little to help users actually organize a camping trip. While finding a nearby available campsite is an important component to camping, organizing the logistics of the trip with friends is frequently problematic. Additionally, camping platforms often provide so many options that making a decision about where to go can be somewhat overwhelming.

## Proposal
Create a website that allows users to organize a camping trip together in a way that simplifies the planning process while also suggesting best nearby campsites in a method that rids of overchoice.

## User types
The goal of this website is to create a service and social network that appeals to all types of campers. Users of the website can be professional or recreational campers, including individuals who may have not camped before but are interested in doing so with others.

### Breakdown of user types: 
#### Campers (Users of our website) 
Campers:
- Browse campsite information
- Book campsite
- View list of campsite they liked/booked


#### Campsite Owner (Users who owns campsite)
Trip Owners may:  
- Create new campsite
- Edit campsite they own
