# Outdoor Camping Website (Web App)

## Problem
 Existing outdoor platforms provide users with access to campsite information and availability but do little to help users actually organize a camping trip. While finding a nearby available campsite is an important component to camping, organizing the logistics of the trip with friends is frequently problematic. Additionally, camping platforms often provide so many options that making a decision about where to go can be somewhat overwhelming.

## Proposal
Create a website that allows users to organize a camping trip together in a way that simplifies the planning process while also suggesting best nearby campsites in a method that rids of overchoice.

## User types
The goal of this website is to create a service and social network that appeals to all types of campers. Users of the website can be professional or recreational campers, including individuals who may have not camped before but are interested in doing so with others.

### Breakdown of user types: 
#### Campers (Users of our website) 
Campers may:
- Browse campsite information
- Create a new trip
- View schedule of a trip they participate in
- (Participate in vote)
- (Make post about their trip)
#### Trip Owner (Organizer)
- On our webpage, Trip owner refers to the organizer of a specific trip. There may be one or more Trip Owners for one trip.
Trip Owners may:  
- Edit the trip they own
- Invite their friends to their trip as guests 
- (Create and manage votes for choosing dates/campsites, etc.)

## Theorized Layout

Login page (links to Forgot Password and Register pages)
Dashboard (currently planned trips and a button or something to plan a new trip)
Create a new trip page
Give details about potential camping trip
Activities
Weather
'# of People
Distance
Dates
Show user a swipeable view of suggested campsites (like a browser version of tinder with campsites meeting their camping trip details) 
We can pull this data from the reacreation.gov API
Invite friends to trip
Friends receive email or text
Create account
Click trip and then choose their available dates
Our app finds best dates given availability of all users in trip
Based on friendsâ€™ available dates update suggested campsites for trip and update the suggest dates for trip
(Not sure about how to do this part best) Users determine which of the suggested campsites they want
maybe some voting feature
or we allow the users to debate themselves and have the creator select the campsite
Campsite and dates are confirmed
Share trip options (make a public view for that trip showing details and various activities)
Done
